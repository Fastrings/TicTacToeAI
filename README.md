# Tic-Tac-Toe in Python

Author : Arthur Launoy <arthur.launoy88@gmail.com>

## SUMMARY

Simple TicTacToe command-line game with added AIs playing the game. The idea behind this project came from reading this excellent post from Robert Heaton, available [here](https://robertheaton.com/2018/10/09/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-3-a/.).

## USAGE

python main.py

&emsp;Play against the computer. More instructions will be prompted on the command line.

python main.py battles [num] [ai1] [ai2]

&emsp;Launch any *num* number of games pitching *ai1* and *ai2* against each other. The AI *ai1* will always play first. Adding save at the end of this line saves the result of the battles to the database.


## STATISTICS

After running the *battles* option a good number of times, we can obtain statistics on 
our game of TicTacToe. Here are mine, visualized using Microsoft's tool, Power BI.
